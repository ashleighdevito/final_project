Movies

Big-budget movies carry a large financial risk.  In order to help make decisions on release strategy, we will create an application to predict the box office success of a film. 
We will gather data on historical movie releases to create an algorithm and predict a range of box office earnings for future debuts.
We aim to look at data gathered regarding releases over the past 15 years (2006-present).

Data will be stored in an AWS database.

A machine learning model will look at this historial data and then be applied to several upcoming new releases. 

A webpage encompassing the project will contain:
-a report page describing the project process, including results from several models (linear regression, random forest classifier, neural network)
-the predictor page to display estimated range of Box Office Revenue. The new release data will be scraped and stored in an API.
-statistics page outlining which features are weighted the most heavily to the model results
